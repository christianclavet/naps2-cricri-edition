# NAPS2 (Not Another PDF Scanner 2) (CriCri Edition - Fork of NAPS2)

NAPS2 is a document scanning application with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Scan your documents from WIA- and TWAIN-compatible scanners, organize the pages as you like, and save them as PDF, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, and other file formats. Requires .NET Framework 4.0 or higher.

Visit the NAPS2 home page at [www.naps2.com](http://www.naps2.com).

## NOTE (About this fork): 
I, Christian Clavet, not the original developper of this excellent application, plan to rework the application for supporting a method I prefer for Batch Scanning as post-process in a non-destructive manner.

Currently, Only added the ability to have more information when scanning|importing image, and full barcode reading (not just PATCHCODE)

Here is a screenshot (may 2022)
