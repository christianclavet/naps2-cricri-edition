## For developers
Have a look at the [Developer Onboarding](https://www.naps2.com/doc-dev-onboarding.html) page.

## NOTE (About this fork): 
I, Christian Clavet, not the original developper of this excellent application, plan to rework the application for supporting a method I prefer for Batch Scanning as post-process in a non-destructive manner.

Currently, Only added the ability to have more information when scanning|importing image, and full barcode reading (not just PATCHCODE)

Here is a screenshot (may 2022)
